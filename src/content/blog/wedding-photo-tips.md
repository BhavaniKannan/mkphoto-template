Weddings are magical ‚Äî full of joy, color, and emotion. But capturing those moments beautifully takes more than just a camera. Whether you're planning your big day or helping a loved one, here are 5 tips to ensure your wedding photographs are timeless and stunning:

## 1. Choose the Right Photographer

Your photographer is your storyteller. Review portfolios, meet in person, and ensure their style aligns with your vision ‚Äî be it candid, cinematic, traditional, or documentary. Trust and comfort with your photographer make a huge difference.

## 2. Plan a Pre-Wedding Shoot

A pre-wedding session helps you get comfortable in front of the camera and builds a bond with your photographer. It also gives you a chance to create beautiful memories in a relaxed setting ‚Äî think beaches, hills, or even your favorite caf√©.

## 3. Timing is Everything

Golden hour (just after sunrise or before sunset) provides soft, flattering light ‚Äî perfect for romantic shots. Discuss your schedule with your photographer to plan for these time slots and avoid harsh midday sun.

From jewelry and attire to floral arrangements and invitation cards ‚Äî small details matter. Have them ready for your photographer to capture early in the day before the chaos begins.
