You’ve booked your couple shoot, chosen a beautiful location, and now comes the big question:  
**"What should we wear?"**

Worry not! We’re here with practical, picture-perfect outfit ideas to help you look your best together.

---

## 1. Coordinate, Don’t Match

Avoid dressing in identical outfits. Instead, choose colors that complement each other. Think pastels + neutrals, or bold + subtle combinations.

> 👗 *Example:* A flowy peach dress for her + white shirt and beige trousers for him.

---

## 2. Stick to Solid Colors or Minimal Patterns

Loud prints and logos can distract from the emotion and connection in your photos. Solid colors, soft florals, and minimal textures are always a safe bet.

---

## 3. Dress for the Location

Your outfits should vibe with your shoot location:

- **Beach**: Light fabrics, barefoot, breezy looks  
- **Heritage Sites**: Ethnic outfits like sarees or kurta sets  
- **Urban Cityscape**: Casual chic or edgy streetwear  
- **Garden/Park**: Soft colors and natural tones

---

## 4. Bring Two Looks (if Possible)

One casual, one semi-formal. This gives your album variety. For example:

- **Look 1**: Casual denim + plain tees  
- **Look 2**: Elegant dress + blazer combo

---

## 5. Add Personal Touches

Incorporate accessories or props that reflect your story—matching bracelets, hats, a camera, or even your pet 🐾

---

## 6. Prioritize Comfort

If you're uncomfortable in what you're wearing, it will show. Choose fits that allow you to move, laugh, hug, and sit comfortably.

---

## Bonus: Grooming & Styling

- Hair & makeup matter. Keep it soft, natural, and photo-ready.
- Iron your clothes! Wrinkles show up more in HD.

---

## Final Words

There are no “rules”—only guidelines. At the end of the day, wear what makes you feel **confident, beautiful, and connected** to your partner.
